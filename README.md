# health_insurance_premium_predict

Health insurance premium prediction was made by using Random Forest Regressor. 
I chose Google Colab as the notebook. You can use whatever you want.

The dataset contains data about the age of the person, gender of the person, Body Mass Index of the person, how many children the person is having, whether the person smokes or not, the region where the person lives and the charges of the insurance premium.
